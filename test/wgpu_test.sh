# WebGPU carts in wasmcart-run (SPEC.md, "WebGPU").
#
# Needs a build configured with WASMCART_WGPU_JS_DIR and NATIVE_DAWN_DIR (so
# build/wgpu/ exists) and a WebGPU adapter. Runs headless on SDL's offscreen
# driver: the cart renders into its host-owned texture and --shot reads it.
#
# Fixtures (test/wgpu/*.wasc) are copies of wasmcart's test/fixtures, whose C
# sources describe them:
#   wgpucart     host device, "#canvas" surface, a compute result read back with
#                mapAsync (the background turns (42,0,255)), an error scope,
#                32 MB of memory growth
#   dualgpu      imports gl AND WebGPU; WebGPU draws green
#   dualgpu_bad  calls glClear whatever the host selected; must trap
#   gpuapi2/3    gpu_api values the cart does not back; refused
#   wgpufake     imports a WebGPU function the glue lacks; refused
#   wasicart     wgpucart built with wasi-sdk (wasip1-threads, two workers)
#   wgpuedges    reconfigures its surface from 128x96 to 160x120 at frame 10
#                and draws blue from then on
#
# Every run must also EXIT cleanly: teardown with GPU work in flight used to
# abort or segfault in node::FreeEnvironment.
#
