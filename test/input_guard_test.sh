# Does the standalone player stop treating keys as gamepad buttons while the
# cart is taking text?
#
# This lives in main.c, not the library, so there is no API to call -- the
# player owns its own input polling. A source check is the honest option: it
# cannot prove the runtime behaviour, but it does catch the regression, which is
# someone deleting the guard while refactoring input.
#
# The bug it guards against shipped in v0.3.0: poll_keyboard_as_pad() ran
# unconditionally, so typing a name also played the game -- "w" walked the
# player, Q/E fired the shoulders, Return pressed Start.

# Run: sh test/input_guard_test.sh
